\section{Apps for Ghent data-dive 09/03}
{\bf present}: Pieter Colpaert, Leenke Dedonder, Everyone of the team except Damian\\
{\bf purpose}: Attend presentations about open data that is provided/available concering the libraries of Ghent and their collections\\
{\bf results}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It became clear that the data that is provided to us lacks a lot of metadata about the books (e.g: authors, genre, number of pages, ...), but does provide general identifiers that could be used to hook into other services (e.g. ISBN).
  \item The Bibnet catalogus API could be used to get the additional metadata that is lacking from the library data set.
  \item A lot of data on the collection of books in the UGent are also provided as open data and appears to be uniquely identified by URLs. This might be useful in the context of linked data.
\end{itemize}
