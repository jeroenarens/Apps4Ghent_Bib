\chapter{Overview of meetings}

\section{Meeting with Team 13/02}
{\bf present}: Everyone of the team\\
{\bf purpose}: Assign team leader who will contact the client to schedule a meeting.\\
{\bf result}: Jeroen is assigned as team leader, he will make an appointment with our client during the 3rd week of the semester.

\section{Meeting with Client 25/02}

{\bf present}: Everyone of the team, Professor Mannens, Koen from Digipolis, Professor Van den Poel, Pieter Colpaert from REC, Pieter Blomme, 2 spokes people from the library and Leenke (journalist student)\\
{\bf purpose}: First introduction to every party and getting to know the scope of the project.\\
{\bf result}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each party discussed their involvement in the project and what they would like to gain from it. This information will be used to define the actual output of the project. We proposed a website that visualizes borrowed books on a map of Ghent. All parties agreed this would (in some way) fit in with their individual goals.
\item The library of Ghent has two goals in mind. The first one is to make the distribution of books between the different libraries at Ghent more efficient. The idea is to find correlations based on geographical data to predict what kind of books need to be available at the different library sites.\\ The second suggestion is to define new (hidden) genres. These can be used to recommend books towards the readers themselves.
\item The journalists want to find a story which can be interesting for the people of Ghent. This needs to be presented in a creative manner.
\item The master students of marketing want to use the data to do analysis upon. Based on this analysis, they can develop a predictive model in regard with the books and users at the library.
\item REC wants to have an inspiring project and wants to profile the UGent as a multimedia university.
\item A lot of suggestions were given at the meeting and have been documented in a separate document so that they may be used to figure out what can be done within the limited time that is provided to us, as well as to give us inspiration for future suggestions.
\end{itemize}
\section{Meeting with Team 25/02}
{\bf present}: Everyone of the team\\
{\bf purpose}: Define an initial scope to work upon during the semester
\begin{itemize}
\item For the front-end of the website, first a user interface will be developed on which queries can be executed by the journalists as aid for them to find a story behind the data. Afterwards the visualization of this data will be made more creative. E.g. an interactive map with the data displayed, several graphs, ...
\item To store the data at the back-end a NoSQL database tool will be used. The tool we will use is MongoDB. With MongoDB we can store the data and already make a basis semantical network. For the data-analysis, a basic model can be employed which will just look at obvious correlations. Later on the students of marketing can analyse the data to enhance this model.
\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting with Prof. Mannens 26/02}
{\bf present}: Prof Mannens, assistent, everyone of the team\\
{\bf purpose}: Discuss previous meetings and decide on what needs to be done next, get some feedback about the current progress and our current approach\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item We should focus our attention on the two most important clients, being the library of Ghent and the city of Ghent. We should then try to find a way to incorporate the journalists students into the project.
  \item Just forget about the marketing students, since we can't satisfy their needs.
  \item We will focus on using \textbf{open data} instead of the raw data.
  \item The most promising project we will focus on is a \emph{visualisation of the distribution of the books across Ghent over time}.
  \item If possible it might be nice to incorporate the concept of \emph{Goodreads}, which we could suggest on the \emph{data dive}.
\end{itemize}
